datatype
========

Datatype is a collection of tools that help manage anonymous datatypes and
currently has support for validation and value coercion.

What is an anonymous datatype?
------------------------------

An anonymous datatype is anything that can be constructed with a small set of
built-ins and primitives, specifically: dictionaries, lists, tuples, strings,
integers, and floats.
